Simple algorithm that crawls through whole numbers one by one to each side of zero in order to try and find the whole number solutions for F(x) = 0 through brute force.

It has a limited search range (1,000,000 as it is) and uses no search or interpolation arlgorithms since they only output one root based on the initial guess, and since these are blind guesses anyway I preferred to stick to the more reliable yet more inefficient solution
